### Hi, I'm Cruz! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an aspiring software engineer with a passion for solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. Iâ€™m currently finishing my Computer Science degree at Eastern Oregon University. Iâ€™ve been programming for several years and enjoy tackling challenges that involve efficient problem-solving and optimization. I focus on improving my skills in various languages and technologies and am always eager to learn and explore new concepts.

Feel free to check out my repositories and reach out if youâ€™d like to collaborate or discuss interesting projects!
